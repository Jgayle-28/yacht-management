Think of Mykonos as a simple whitewashed paradise steeped in history and tradition. There is definitely something for everybody and Mykonos will exceed your expectations, however if you are looking for something a little quieter, July and August can get crowded.`,

It is without a doubt, considered to be the most sought-after romantic hotspot in Greece and for very specific reasons. Almost anywhere you go on the island you will be presented with a magnificent view. Literally breath-taking sights seem to be around every corner. There are not many places in the world, where you can exclusively enjoy panoramic views, of the most glorious sunsets while perched on the rim of a massive active volcano in the middle of the sea!`,

    introParagraph: `When you hear Athens, your mind instantly wonders to a loud, hustling, bustling city where the old meets the new; a city of ancient monuments like the Parthenon, the national gardens, and then of course there are the winding streets of Plaka. A ‘village’ within the city and an ‘island’ feel for those who don’t have time to visit the islands themselves; typically touristy, pedestrianised and commercial but arguably one of the nicest neighbourhoods in central Athens! Athens is simply brimming with creative energy with its museums, theatres, exhibitions, festivals and for sure there are no limits to shops, restaurants, bars and clubs. But apart from its illustrious history, Athens is now home to a dynamic new generation of entrepreneurs who are enhancing the city’s look, feel and vibe.`,
